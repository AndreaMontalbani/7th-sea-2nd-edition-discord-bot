A dice roller bot for your discord server

## How to use

Install discord python wrapper following these instruction https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py (shoutout to the creator)

be careful with your token.

You can then add your bot to a discord server where you have admin privileges, start your app with ```python arrbot.py``` from terminal and type 
in the discord chat in the server where you added you bot to ```!roll <n>``` to roll a wanted number (n) of dice and get a message showing the roll result and the number of increments calculated.
